# Weather-Dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a web application where users can search for a city and the page will display the current weather conditions along with a 5 day forecast. The application display features the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions along with the weather data values. The values shown include temperature, what the temperature feels like, wind speed, humidity percentage and the UV Index. The UV Index is color-coded, indicating the UV levels as ok, moderate, and sever. The user's search history will also be saved in the user's local storage. When they click in the search history of past cities, the page will load that city's current weather data.
